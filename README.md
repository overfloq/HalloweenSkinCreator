# How to use
1. Download a pre-compiled copy of the code, or compile it yourself (depends on PastelEx library).
2. Open command prompt in directory where you have the program downloaded. Adding your skin image will make the process easier.
3. In command prompt, run command `HalloweenSkinCreator` with a single argument, path or just filename of your skin file. Example is `HalloweenSkinCreator "MySkinPicture.png"`. The program will then automatically create a new picture, `MySkinPicture - Halloween Mask.png` in the example case.
